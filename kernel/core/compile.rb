  #
  # 1.  if given a .rb or no/any-extensioned file and there is a
  #     compiled version of the same file that is not older than
  #     the source file (based on File.mtime), the compiled one
  #     is loaded directly to avoid the compilation overhead.
  # 2.  if a .rb file is given but it does not exist, the system
  #     will try to load the corresponding .rbc instead (to allow
  #     distributing just .rbc files.)
  #
  # If the path given starts with ./, ../, ~/ or /, it is treated
